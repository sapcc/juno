# Example App

The example app serves as a demonstration application where we thoroughly test and implement interactions between multiple components following our best practices. Additionally, it functions as a prime illustration of how Juno components can be effectively utilized.

# Best practices

- [React Zustand] implementation with React context
- [React Zustand] store sliced and structured in lib folder.
- [React Zustand] [Avoid Rerenders] Zustand export single States instead of the whole Store.
- [React Query] [Avoid Rerenders] Use of hook `useQueryClilentFn` isolated in AsyncWorker component.
- [React Query] use of hook `useQueryClilentFn` to encapsulate all queries and react to changes.
- [Avoid Rerenders] use of hook `useUrlState` instead isolated in AsyncWorker component.
- [Coworking Experience] use of hook `useUrlState` without boiler plate.
- [Enhance Rendering Experience] Use of hook `useEndlessScrollList`.
- [Coworking Experience] Components splitted in contexts.
- Use of fetchLocal to simulate a local db.
