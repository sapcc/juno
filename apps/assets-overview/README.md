# Assets Overview

This app displays all available Juno apps using the manifest.json file. The manifest.json file is located on the assets server and contains various data, including the path to the build of the app.

This app uses the same techniques as all Juno apps and is integrated in the same way via widget-loader. It serves both as an overview of available apps and as an example of what such an app can look like.
