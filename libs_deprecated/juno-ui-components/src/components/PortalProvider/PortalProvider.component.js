/**
 * This provider acts as a container for portals. All portals within a Juno app should be added as children to this.
 * The PortalProvider itself needs to be placed inside the Juno StyleProvider, otherwise styles might not be applied correctly on children of portals.
 *
 * The main task of the PortalProvider is to offer a place (portal) where certain components
 * such as modals are mounted. Many existing libs place such components outside of the
 * current application's DOM tree, because the control over creating and scheduling
 * the components is not with the application but with the lib. This is not a problem
 * as long as the application is in the global document tree. Once shadow root comes
 * into play, it changes. In this case, such components are placed outside of the
 * shadow root and individual app styles are not applied. The PortalProvider solves
 * this problem by creating the portal that lives in the same DOM tree as the actual app.
 *
 * The PortalProvider is appended at the top of the application tree and all lower
 * components are children of it. This means that all children can access the portal.
 * There are two ways you can do this. Via the ProtalProvider.Portal component or via
 * a usePortalRef hook. While the component places all children in the portal, the hook
 * returns a React reference object to the DOM element.
