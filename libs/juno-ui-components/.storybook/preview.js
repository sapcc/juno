     * We're using a custom docs page setup here at the moment because by default the storybook docspage renders the first
     * story from the stories file as a special "primary" story that is adjustable with the args table but it does not
     * include the primary story below with the list of other stories. This leads to the description for the primary
     * story not being displayed anywhere on the docspage which is annoying. Therefore I've adjusted the default Docs Page
     * to include the primary story with the story list. There's an open issue that might fix this issue and render the
     * need for a custom page obsolete: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8093
     *
     * Also there's still an open issue regarding the descriptions of stories. Ideally it would be possible to write standard
     * jsdoc descriptions for stories but currently this doesn't work. Instead you have to pass the description as a parameter.
     * This issue is here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8527
