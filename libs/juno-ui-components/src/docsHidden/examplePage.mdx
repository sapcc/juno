# Welcome

Juno is a powerful React library designed to streamline your web development projects. The library offers a wide range of components and tools to simplify the development process and enhance the user experience. With Juno, you can create modern and responsive user interfaces with ease.
Juno is extending W3C Standards to provide a more versatile and developer-friendly experience. Take the "textarea" component, for example. While Juno might not explicitly define the "rows" prop, Juno allows to use the props according to the standard.
