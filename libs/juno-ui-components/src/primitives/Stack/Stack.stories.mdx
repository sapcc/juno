# Stack

A stack is a layout primitive that can be used to compose multiple components horizontally or vertically with or without space between them.

## Horizontal Stack

By default the child elements are stacked horizontally, so in it's simplest form the stack doesn't require any parameters.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Stories.Horizontal} name="Horizontal" />
</Canvas>

If necessary, a gap can be specified which denotes the gap between each direct child element and its neighbour.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Stories.HorizontalGap} name="Horizontal" />
</Canvas>
