# Because the hoisting heuristics aren't standardized and predictable,
# PnP operating under strict mode will prevent packages to require
# dependencies that they don't explicitly list (even if one of their
# other dependencies happens to depend on it). This may cause issues
# with some packages.

# To address this problem, Yarn ships with a "loose" mode
